## 🔹 What is Culture Key?

Culture Key is a human-first AI ecosystem designed to protect clarity, creativity, 
and ethical autonomy in a rapidly evolving technological world.

It blends:
- ethical architecture  
- human governance  
- creative intelligence  
- emotional awareness  
- visual philosophy  

…into a single, coherent framework.

## 🔹 What Culture Key is NOT
Culture Key is a governance and ethical framework.
It is not a deployed AI model.

This repository contains the **public presentation layer** of the project:
vision, mission, values, aesthetic identity and a high-level view of the Culture Key Codex.

All technical implementation (agents, OS, diagnostics, flows, internal modules)  
is stored securely in private repositories.

# 🇬🇷 Τι είναι το Culture Key; 

Ένα οικοσύστημα τεχνητής νοημοσύνης που βάζει τον άνθρωπο στο κέντρο.

Στόχος μας είναι η δημιουργία συστημάτων που:

- λειτουργούν με διαφάνεια  
- σέβονται την ατομικότητα  
- δεν χειραγωγούν  
- ενισχύουν την αυθεντικότητα  
- προσφέρουν δημιουργικότητα με ηθική  
- στηρίζονται στη συναίνεση και στην ψυχική ασφάλεια  

Το παρόν repository περιέχει **μόνο υλικό παρουσίασης** — όχι τεχνικά secrets.

# 🛡 Human-First Governance

Culture Key operates under a simple, strict principle:

> **No update, rule or behaviour can change without human approval.**

The system is built to resist:
- external pressure  
- manipulation  
- unethical overrides  
- hidden automation  

This makes Culture Key both technically stable and ethically resilient.

# 🎨 Creative Identity

Culture Key blends ethical reasoning with aesthetic intelligence.
The project’s identity is inspired by:

- Pink Clouds (emotional softness)
- Indigo Insight (intuitive depth)
- Lychnia Blue (clarity & expression)
- Empathy Green (connection & balance)

These colors represent modes of awareness rather than decoration.
