## 🔰 Pre-Scale Readiness Signal

Culture Key is designed for **pre-scale AI governance assurance**.

This framework helps organizations identify structural risk **before** AI systems reach production scale.

**Pre-Scale Structural Check covers:**

- authority gaps  
- escalation latency  
- rollback exposure  
- decision integrity risks  
- human oversight coverage  

> Governance capacity becomes the real bottleneck at scale.  
> Culture Key addresses it early.

# 🌒 Culture Key — Public Overview  
*A human-first AI governance layer for systems approaching scale.*

## Why Culture Key exists

AI systems are scaling faster than the governance structures meant to contain them.

The real bottleneck is no longer model capability —  
it is whether systems can scale without structural, ethical, and operational risk.

Culture Key addresses the **prescale gap**.

---

## What Culture Key is

Culture Key is a human-first AI governance ecosystem designed to help teams:

- scale AI systems responsibly  
- contain structural and behavioral risk early  
- maintain human oversight under real-world pressure  
- avoid late-stage governance retrofits  

It functions as a **prescale governance layer** that can be integrated before high-risk deployment.

---

## Where it fits in the lifecycle

Culture Key operates **before and during scale**, when:

- capabilities are accelerating  
- guardrails are still fluid  
- and small design decisions compound into systemic risk  

It is most useful when teams ask:

> "Are we structurally safe to scale this?"
