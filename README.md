Culture Key is designed for **pre-scale AI governance assurance**.

This framework helps organizations identify structural risk **before** AI systems reach production scale.

**Pre-Scale Structural Check covers:**

- authority gaps  
- escalation latency  
- rollback exposure  
- decision integrity risks  
- human oversight coverage  

> Governance capacity becomes the real bottleneck at scale.  
> Culture Key surfaces and addresses this risk early.

# 🌑 Culture Key — Public Overview

*A human-first AI governance layer for systems approaching scale.*
Designed for teams building AI systems that must scale safely.

---

## Why Culture Key exists

AI systems are scaling faster than the governance structures meant to contain them.

The real bottleneck is no longer model capability —  
it is whether systems can scale without structural, ethical, and operational risk.

Culture Key addresses the **prescale gap**.

---

## What Culture Key is

Culture Key is a human-first AI governance ecosystem designed to help teams:

- scale AI systems responsibly  
- contain structural and behavioral risk early  
- maintain human oversight under real-world pressure  
- avoid late-stage governance retrofits  

It functions as a **prescale governance layer** that can be integrated before high-risk deployment.

---

## Where it fits in the lifecycle

Culture Key operates **before and during scale**, when:

- capabilities are accelerating  
- guardrails are still fluid  
- and small design decisions compound into systemic risk  

It is most useful when teams ask:

> "Are we structurally safe to scale this?"

## What this public repo contains

This repository provides **structural and conceptual material only**.

It includes:

- governance architecture  
- ethical state model (high-level)  
- risk framing  
- system design patterns  

It **does not** expose sensitive implementation or operational details.

## Core design principles

Culture Key systems are built to:

- operate with explicit human governance  
- preserve user autonomy and consent  
- surface risk before failure  
- remain inspectable, accountable, and traceable by design  
- support creative and high-agency use cases safely
  

## Intended audience

Culture Key is designed for:

- AI teams approaching scale  
- responsible AI leads  
- AI governance and safety teams  
- founders building high-agency AI systems
