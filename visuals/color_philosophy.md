# 🎨 Culture Key — Color Philosophy

Culture Key uses color not as decoration but as a **language of awareness**.

Color is also an ethical signal — guiding interaction, intention, and responsibility.

Colors represent modes of intention, clarity and emotional resonance.

## Why colors matter

Colors act as a visual interface into the ecosystem:

- identify modes of interaction

- enhance creative expression  

They form the **baseline visual philosophy** of Culture Key.
