# Versioning Policy

The Versioning Policy ensures transparency, traceability, and auditability
of all governance and ethical framework updates within Culture Key.

---

## Scope

Versioning applies to:

- Codex releases  
- Rule modifications  
- Governance structure changes  
- Safety and policy updates  

---

## Version Structure

Each version increment must follow documented change control.

Tracked elements include:

- Codex versions  
- Rule updates  
- Governance changes  

---

## Required Change Record

Every approved update must explicitly record:

- **What changed**  
- **Why it changed**  
- **Who approved** (Human Governance Layer)  
- **When it was applied**  
- **Impact scope** (recommended)

---

## Governance Requirement

No material ethical or behavioral change may be released without:

- documented review  
- double human approval (HGL)  
- version increment  

---

## Design Goal

- Full auditability  
- Governance transparency  
- Historical traceability  
- Trust at scale  

Culture Key treats version history as part of system integrity,
not as administrative overhead.
