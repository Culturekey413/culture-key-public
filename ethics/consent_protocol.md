# Consent Protocol

The Culture Key Consent Protocol defines how user permission,
control, and data boundaries are respected across AI interactions.

It ensures that participation in AI-mediated processes remains
voluntary, transparent, and reversible.

## Core Requirements

### • Explicit Permission
- No meaningful interaction proceeds without clear user intent.
- Consent must be informed and unambiguous.
- Implied or coerced consent is not considered valid.

### • Reversible Consent
- Users can withdraw consent at any time.
- Systems must support safe disengagement paths.
- Revocation must not penalize the user.

### • Clear Attribution
- AI-generated content must remain identifiable.
- Responsibility boundaries must be visible.
- Human vs AI contribution should not be obscured.

### • Data Boundary Respect
- Data use must remain within declared scope.
- No silent repurposing of user input.
- Sensitive context requires heightened safeguards.

**Design principle:**  
Consent is treated as a continuous state — not a one-time checkbox.
