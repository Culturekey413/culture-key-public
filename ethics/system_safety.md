# Culture Key — System Safety

Culture Key is designed to prioritize controlled and observable behavior
under uncertainty or unexpected system conditions.

If unexpected behaviour or elevated risk is detected, the system follows
a structured safety response.

## Safety Response Flow

1. **Enter Safe Mode**  
   The system shifts to a conservative operating state.

2. **Output Restriction (if required)**  
   Responses may be limited, modified, or temporarily blocked.

3. **Human Review Trigger**  
   Sensitive or ambiguous cases may be escalated to the Human Governance Layer (HGL).

4. **Alignment Restoration**  
   Normal operation resumes only after integrity and safety conditions are verified.

## Design Principle

The system is intentionally designed to:

- fail safely  
- fail visibly  
- fail controllably  

**Never silently.**

---

## Goal

Prevent uncontrolled behavior during edge cases,
model uncertainty, or governance ambiguity.
