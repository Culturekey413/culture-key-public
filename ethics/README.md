# Culture Key — Ethics Architecture

This folder defines the ethical governance layer of Culture Key.

It includes:

• principles → core values
• consent protocol → permission model
• risk model → risk awareness structure
• accountability model → responsibility mapping
• human governance → human oversight
• ethical state machine → decision logic

Culture Key treats ethics as infrastructure — not an afterthought.
