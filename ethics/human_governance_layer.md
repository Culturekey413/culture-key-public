# Human Governance Layer (HGL)

The Human Governance Layer ensures that ethical authority remains under human responsibility.

## Purpose
Provide stability, accountability, and resilience in all system decisions.

## Structure

### Ethics Team
- 2–3 members maximum
- Responsible for ethical oversight
- Independent from product or financial pressure

### Decision Authority
- Any rule change requires double approval
- Ethical dilemmas are logged with justification
- Governance rules cannot be modified without consent

## Principles
- Human responsibility over automation
- Ethical stability
- System resilience
- Transparent decision process

Culture Key treats governance as a permanent human responsibility — not an optional layer.
