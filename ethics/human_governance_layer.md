# Human Governance Layer (HGL)

The Human Governance Layer ensures that ethical authority remains under explicit human responsibility.

---

## Purpose

Provide stability, accountability, and resilience across all system decisions and behavioral changes.

The HGL acts as the final human oversight boundary of the Culture Key ecosystem.

---

## Structure

### Ethics Team

- 2–3 members maximum  
- Responsible for ethical oversight  
- Operationally independent from product and financial pressure  
- Reviews sensitive or ambiguous cases when escalation is triggered  

---

### Decision Authority

- Any core rule change requires **dual human approval**  
- Ethical dilemmas are logged with documented justification  
- Governance rules cannot be modified without authorized review  
- High-risk changes require explicit sign-off before activation  

---

## Operating Principles

- Human responsibility over automation  
- Ethical stability over reactive changes  
- System resilience under uncertainty  
- Transparent and auditable decision process  

---
## Traceability Principle

Culture Key requires that governance-relevant decisions remain traceable and auditable.

This includes:

- rule changes  
- ethical escalations  
- safety overrides  
- human governance interventions  

The system does not require full behavioral surveillance of users.

Traceability applies to **decision accountability**, not user monitoring.

## Governance Position

Culture Key treats governance as a **permanent human responsibility**,  
not an optional safety layer.

The HGL exists to ensure that:

- ethical boundaries remain enforceable  
- system behavior remains reviewable  
- human oversight remains structurally embedded

**Status:** Public Architecture Layer  
**Scope:** High-level governance transparency (implementation remains private)
