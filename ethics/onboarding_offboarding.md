# Onboarding / Offboarding Policy

Defines the access control lifecycle for the Culture Key ecosystem,
ensuring secure, traceable, and governed participation.

---

## Purpose

To prevent unauthorized access, reduce misuse risk,
and maintain governance visibility across the system lifecycle.

---

## Onboarding

All new users, contributors, or collaborators must complete:

### Access Orientation
- Introduction to Culture Key principles
- Acceptable and restricted usage overview
- Governance and accountability expectations

### Role Assignment
- Role-based access defined (least privilege principle)
- Scope of permissions documented
- Access approval recorded

### Acknowledgment
- Confirmation of ethical use expectations
- Agreement to follow governance rules

---

## Offboarding

When access is no longer required or is revoked:

### Access Removal
- Immediate permission revocation
- Token/API key invalidation (if applicable)
- Session termination

### Credential Hygiene
- Rotation of shared secrets (if any)
- Review of residual access paths

### Confidentiality Continuity
- Confidentiality obligations remain in force
- Ethical license terms continue to apply

---

## Audit & Traceability

All onboarding and offboarding actions must be:

- logged  
- timestamped  
- attributable to an approver  

This supports Human Governance Layer (HGL) oversight.

---

## Goal

Ensure controlled access,
clear responsibility boundaries,
and resilient governance at scale.
