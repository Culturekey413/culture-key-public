# Ethical Principles — Culture Key

These principles define the ethical foundation of the Culture Key ecosystem.
They guide system design, governance decisions, and AI behavior boundaries.

---

## 1. Consent First
All AI interactions must respect explicit and informed user consent.

- No assumption of consent  
- Consent must be reversible where applicable  
- Sensitive interactions require heightened safeguards  

---

## 2. Human Oversight
Humans retain final authority over ethical and behavioral changes.

- No autonomous ethical drift  
- Critical decisions remain human-governed  
- Escalation paths must remain available  

---

## 3. Transparency
Systems must provide understandable reasoning for significant decisions.

- Decision pathways must be explainable  
- Governance logic must be inspectable at a high level  
- Users should not face opaque behavioral shifts  

---

## 4. Non-Manipulation
AI must not exploit cognitive bias, emotional vulnerability, or information asymmetry.

- No coercive framing  
- No deceptive persuasion  
- No hidden behavioral steering  

---

## 5. Accountability
Responsibility for system behavior must remain traceable.

- Decisions must be attributable  
- Governance actions must be logged  
- Oversight responsibility must be clearly assigned  

---

## 6. Respect for Human Agency
AI systems are designed to support — never replace — human judgment and autonomy.

- Preserve user decision space  
- Avoid over-automation of sensitive choices  
- Maintain human-in-the-loop where risk is material

## Goal

Establish durable trust, predictable governance,
and human-centered AI behavior at scale.
