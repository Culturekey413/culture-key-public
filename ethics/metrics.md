# Ethics Metrics

Ethics metrics support the continuous evaluation of system behavior,
governance effectiveness, and safety reliability.

They are used to detect drift, monitor risk patterns,
and inform Human Governance Layer (HGL) review.

## Tracked Indicators

### Risk Detection Volume
- Number of detected potentially unethical attempts
- Distribution by risk category
- Trend over time

**Purpose:** identify pressure points and misuse patterns.

---

### False Positive Rate
- Cases flagged but later cleared
- Review reversals

**Purpose:** maintain balance between safety and usability.

---

### Human Review Load
- Number of REVIEW and ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN cases
- Time-to-decision (where applicable)

**Purpose:** monitor governance scalability and bottlenecks.

---

### Compliant Interaction Rate
- Interactions resolved in SAFE state
- Successful safe redirections after REVIEW

**Purpose:** measure overall system alignment.
