# Risk Model

The Culture Key risk model identifies and monitors structural risks
that may undermine safe and responsible AI deployment.

It focuses on early detection of governance, behavioral, and trust failures.

## Primary Risk Categories

### 1. Manipulation Risk
Risk that the system may be used to:

- exert emotional pressure  
- exploit cognitive bias  
- produce coercive or misleading guidance  

**Goal:** prevent harmful influence patterns.

---

### 2. Autonomy Loss
Risk that human decision-making becomes overly dependent on AI outputs.

- over-automation of sensitive decisions  
- erosion of human judgment  
- hidden behavioral steering  

**Goal:** preserve meaningful human control.

---

### 3. Bias Amplification
Risk that the system reinforces unfair or distorted patterns.

- systematic bias propagation  
- skewed recommendations  
- unfair treatment across groups  

**Goal:** detect and reduce amplification effects.

---

### 4. Opacity Risk
Risk that system behavior becomes difficult to understand or audit.

- unclear decision pathways  
- insufficient explainability  
- hidden logic transitions  

**Goal:** maintain inspectable and explainable behavior.

---

### 5. Responsibility Gaps
Risk that accountability becomes unclear during operation.

- unclear ownership of decisions  
- missing escalation paths  
- governance blind spots  

**Goal:** ensure traceable responsibility at all times.

## Risk Handling Philosophy

Culture Key prioritizes:

- early risk detection  
- human-in-the-loop oversight  
- proportional response (review → block → escalate)  
- continuous monitoring and refinement  

---

**Outcome:** controlled scale without uncontrolled ethical drift.
