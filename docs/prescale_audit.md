# 🧭 Culture Key — Pre-Scale Governance Audit

**Identify structural AI risks before they become production failures.**

Culture Key provides a human-first prescale governance check designed for teams building AI systems that are approaching real-world deployment and scale.

---

## 🔰 What This Is

A structured prescale review that helps organizations detect governance and safety gaps **before high-risk scale exposure**.

It focuses on structural readiness — not model performance.

---

## 🎯 What We Examine

The Pre-Scale Structural Check maps critical risk surfaces such as:

- authority gaps  
- escalation latency  
- rollback exposure  
- decision integrity risks  
- human oversight coverage  
- consent and boundary clarity  

> Governance capacity is often the hidden bottleneck at scale.

---

## 🧪 When Teams Use Culture Key

Most valuable when:

- AI capabilities are accelerating  
- guardrails are still fluid  
- teams are preparing for wider deployment  
- leadership asks:  
  **“Are we structurally safe to scale this?”**

---

## 🛠 What Organizations Receive

Depending on scope:

- Prescale risk snapshot  
- Governance gap identification  
- Human oversight review  
- Escalation path analysis  
- Targeted recommendations  

This is **not a compliance checkbox** —  
it is an early structural signal.

- product teams integrating LLMs  
- responsible AI leads
