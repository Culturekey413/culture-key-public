# Culture Key — System Overview (Public)

Culture Key is a human-first governance and ethical AI framework.
This public repository contains the presentation layer — not internal implementation.

## Core layers

1. **Human Governance Layer (HGL)**
   - No rule or behavior change without human approval.

2. **Codex Root (Governance Core)**
   - Holds the ethical foundation and rule integrity.

3. **Aequitas (Ethical Firewall)**
   - Filters outputs for consent, safety, and integrity.

4. **Lychnia Bridge (Cognitive Translation Layer)**
   - Preserves meaning and alignment between intent and expression.

5. **Magna (Orchestration Layer)**
   - Coordinates system behavior and restores alignment when needed.

6. **PosterKit (Expression Interface)**
   - Produces creative outputs and presentation artifacts.

## What this is (and is not)

- **Is:** governance architecture, ethical constraints, transparency principles.
- **Is not:** a deployed AI model, codebase, or internal operational system.

## Public vs Private

- **Public:** concepts, policies, high-level architecture, diagrams.
- **Private:** implementation details, internal flows, modules, diagnostics.
