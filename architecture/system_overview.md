# Culture Key — System Overview (Public)

Culture Key is a human-first AI governance framework designed to help organizations structure, supervise, and scale AI systems responsibly.

This public repository contains the presentation layer only — not internal implementation.

## Core Layers

### 1. Human Governance Layer (HGL)
Human oversight authority.
- No rule or behavioral change occurs without human approval.
- Defines escalation and accountability boundaries.

### 2. Codex Root (Governance Core)
Policy source of truth.
- Maintains ethical foundations
- Preserves rule integrity
- Anchors system-wide governance logic

### 3. Aequitas (Ethical Firewall)
Runtime ethical guard.
- Filters outputs for consent, safety, and integrity
- Flags boundary violations
- Supports safe interaction patterns

### 4. Lychnia Bridge (Cognitive Translation Layer)
Meaning preservation layer.
- Aligns intent with expression
- Reduces semantic drift
- Supports clarity in AI-human interaction

### 5. Magna (Orchestration Layer)
System coordination layer.
- Monitors cross-component alignment
- Triggers recovery when drift is detected
- Maintains operational coherence

### 6. PosterKit (Expression Interface)
Controlled output layer.
- Generates structured artifacts
- Handles presentation-safe outputs
- Applies expression constraints

## What This Is (and Is Not)

**This IS:**
- governance architecture  
- ethical control framework  
- human oversight model  
- transparency-first design  

**This is NOT:**
- a deployed AI model  
- a training pipeline  
- an autonomous decision system  
- internal production infrastructure

## Public vs Private Scope

**Public repository includes:**
- high-level architecture  
- governance structure  
- ethical principles
